# Foreman
A system for job manage

### Quick start
Foreman is like ThreadPool in java,but it focus on job management instead of thread.If you have a lot of jobs to manage and want to monitor their status and resources in real time,you can use foreman.

### Contributing
Contributing to Foreman doesnâ€™t just mean writing code. Helping new users on the mailing list, testing releases, and improving documentation are also welcome. In fact, proposing significant code changes usually requires first gaining experience and credibility within the community by helping in other ways. This is also a guide to becoming an effective contributor.

#### We uses Github to host. If you want to contribute, please use github's PR (Pull Request) process:
